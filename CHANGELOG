v2.0.0
This more of a structure change than a process change.  Reorganized the file into functions and then 

v1.0.6
-Fixed the read lines loop for the update file check.
-Added a few sleep statements to better follow along when viewing from the terminal.
-Added a beginswith() function since BASH doesn't have one.
-Updates the MySQL/MariaDB backup process to ensure we get a good backup.

v1.0.5
-Added the self-update check to the file to make sure we're always running the latest version.

v1.0.4
-Added MySQL Control function to start and stop MySQL without duplicating code.
-Reduced code for MySQL stop countdown.
-Fixed some echo statements to make logs and stdout output more readable.
-Fixed failure to restart MySQL process because the 'service mysql' checks failed. Now checks for to see if the msqlcmd variable is already set.

v1.0.3
The initial check-in and creation of the repository.  This is the initial code that did the original work to backup and repair the MySQL databases.
